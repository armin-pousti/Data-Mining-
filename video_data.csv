🎙Lyrics Love Me Like You Do - Ellie Goulding:
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

🎤 Lyrics: Imagine Dragons - Believer

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Everyone; If you are feeling down today, remember this: Life has its ups and downs! No matter how bad you feel for how long, you will always get better in the end. But if you are ok or not, hang on to what you believe in and who you are. I hope that you have an amazing day, whether it’s tomorrow, today, or in a few weeks! This music is lovely, it really helps with just relaxing and forgetting about problems. So take the time it took you to read this, and forget that you have any problems
Wow, playlist of my favourites , can&#39;t believe it, thank you ❤
It is amazing👍 and it helps me feel better when I&#39;m feeling down!

And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Heb 9:27)<br>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. (1 Timothy 6:10)<br>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:15)<br>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? (Mark 8:36)
I will listen to these songs every day and listen to them all over again ❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Any single watching here 😂😂😢
Some of the songs on this list are just people screaming at the top of their voices.<br>MOST of the new generation supposedly songs/music is a  barrage of ear damaging and brain damaging NOISE!!<br>I’m so blessed to have grown up in the 70‘s and 80‘s where songs had good relatable and danceable music and rhythm.

How is it possible that 2020 was already three years ago? In a way I still feel like I live in the year 2020. And let&#39;s be honest, the first three years of the decade completely sucked.

My mood is not good after listen this songs my mood amazingly❤ im feel good now thanks
Happy birthday to the one who wants to share their wish with all. If you don&#39;t mind ill try and use your wish a bit. Im fighting the effects of being terminally Ill. I&#39;m not done yet and passed my expected end by 6 months and still going. Holding on in some areas really well, others not so much, but docs are working on it best they can. RUSH hospital is best in nation for my condition and they took me in (a couple years of begging and sending records) and started going to work. And they are still working. Life was pulled from under me but i still refuse to just lay down. It&#39;s getting harder ill admit. Truck which I need for work has died and now I&#39;m getting into some down spots. Maybe a little boost from a birthday wish and those just saying nice things will help a little. Happy birthday and yes everyone matters no matter when it is and no matter if you feel you dont.
to people reading this, we all have something to be grateful for &amp; at least 1 person that loves us, so lets embrace our flaws &amp; listen to this lovely melody:&gt; Thank you so much for lifting my mood &amp; many others as well ❤!! :)
Superd broooo

Absolutely awesome! I&#39;m not a fan, but I love this Double Knot by Stray kids, the back ground music is SICK!! SO DOPE!! <br>I love this and Easy, that&#39;s dope too! I also like Surfing, another dope song!! <br><br>Wow, Stray Kids, are definitely understated when they do dope rap tunes like East and Double Knot. Definitely should collaborate with either a British or American rapper. Those back ground tunes and dance choreography is sick!!

To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life.
Your talent as a guitarist is truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your gift and bringing joy to so many people&#39;s lives.

🎤 Lyrics: Maroon 5 - Memories

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got (Oh-oh)
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (No, no)
Toast to the ones here today (Ayy)
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories (Ayy)
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ooh, yeah)
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

Its 2020 😢😢
this song played on the radio on the last day of school
June 2023, anyone?
This song makes elms sad because the memories I get and good and bad times UGH Man I’m hurting
I have this crush on someone who I haven&#39;t seen in 5 years and now is in one of my classes. This song accurately describes me thinking back to all the memories we had in elementary school, and how we only glance at each other to convey that we still have feelings for each other. Even the people who we lost- those represent our mutual friends who moved away in those 5 years. The people we still got are our mutual friends in some of my classes. Anyways, thank you for your time, and I missed you so much Kymani! Please talk to me one day :)
This song is actually so sad, love it but its hard to hear sometimes.
Ok so ha ha
This is a peaceful song😌
Shout out to those listening in June 2023!!!❤❤❤
I still love this song even it&#39;s 2023
My birthday is at December as well yay
Nice song

This song reminds me of the good times my family did together, but after the divorce, it all changed my life in a bad way and I still wish they didn&#39;t leave
The best song ever🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

It reminds me of my grandma
How many of us have some very fond memories of friends no longer with us. This song is dedicated to them.
ma&#39;am this song makes me so sad cause I went to a graduation like a few days ago and I hugged somebody and they&#39;re not gonna be going to my school anymore which makes me so sad but I literally don&#39;t crying the rest of the night and then I went out on my balcony and I listened to that song watching the city lights
I love its song
This song reminds me that I’ve lost contact with my dad 😢😢😢
my dog died yesterday i played this song at his funeral<br>everybody started to cry because of all the memories
I wonder who&#39;s listening in June, 2024
This is my favorite song

Our faces the SAME.   Everything in my home same same same.  We eat same food  we watch same tv programmes same interests.   Life is easy. Its like. 2 people in 1 body
this is song is my childhood music
This song makes me remember of school since school is over I’ve been sad.
Monday 12 June 2023 this song reminds me of my 2019-2020 mates 😢😢😢

Girl, quit playing<br>We&#39;re just friends, what are you saying?<br>Said &quot;there&#39;s another,&quot; and looked right in my eyes<br>My first love, broke my heart for the first time<br>And I was like<br>Baby, baby, baby, oh<br>Like baby, baby, baby, no<br>Like baby, baby, baby, oh<br>I thought you&#39;d always be mine (mine)<br>Baby, baby, baby, oh<br>Like baby, baby, baby, no<br>Like baby, baby, baby, oh<br>I thought you&#39;d always be mine (mine)<br>Oh, for you, I would have done whatever<br>And I just can&#39;t believe we ain&#39;t together<br>And I wanna play it cool, but I&#39;m losin&#39; you<br>I&#39;ll buy you anything, I&#39;ll buy you any ring<br>And I&#39;m in pieces, baby, fix me<br>And just shake me &#39;til you wake me from this bad dream<br>I&#39;m going down, down, down, down<br>And I just can&#39;t believe my first love won&#39;t be around<br>And I&#39;m like<br>Baby, baby, baby, oh<br>Like baby, baby, baby, no<br>Like baby, baby, baby, oh<br>I thought you&#39;d always be mine (mine)<br>Baby, baby, baby, oh<br>Like baby, baby, baby, no<br>Like baby, baby, baby, oh<br>I thought you&#39;d always be mine (mine)<br>Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love<br>There was nobody that compared to my baby<br>And nobody came between us or could ever come above<br>She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck<br>She woke me up daily, don&#39;t need no Starbucks<br>She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street<br>And at school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend<br>She knows she got me dazin&#39; &#39;cause she was so amazin&#39;<br>And now my heart is breakin&#39; but I just keep on sayin&#39;<br>Baby, baby, baby, oh<br>Like baby, baby,

These songs make me miss my girlfriends I had one in 6th grade her name was Samantha and we got separated from each other when we graduated elementary school man I have to say that actually hurts alot and it’s still hurting me because that means we can’t ever see each other again for the rest of our lives. Because we started going to a different school when we graduated elementary school. And the second one I had in high school her name was Kylie my friend named Maddie forced both of us to break up and my friend named Maddie was behind me and kylies break up at first I still couldn’t figure out how we broke up until Kylie told me that Maddie is the one who is behind our break up I have to say that actually hurts alot and it’s still hurting me its so hard because I had 2 break ups out of my whole life and my life is going through a lot of pain because of these two breakups it’s so hard what my life is going through all that and I feel so heartbroken inside right now it’s so painful both of these breakups actually hurt alot and it’s making me feel so heartbroken inside my life right now 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.

P1Harmony (피원하모니) – 'JUMP (English Version)' LYRIC VIDEO,"P1Harmony (피원하모니) – Digital Single [JUMP (English Version)] LYRIC VIDEO

[Apple Music] https://music.apple.com/kr/album/jump-english-version-single/1691499092

'JUMP (English Version)'는 P1Harmony 여섯 번째 미니 앨범 'HARMONY : ALL IN'의 타이틀곡 'JUMP'의 영어 버전이다. 힙합 베이스의 사운드로 진행되는 얼터너티브 팝 장르의 댄스곡으로, 유니크한 랩 구성과 8비트로 반전되는 후렴 트랙이 만나 색다른 분위기를 선사한다. 고민하거나 망설이기보다는 지금 현재 이 감정을 즐기며 함께 더 높이 ‘JUMP’하여 올라가자는 P1Harmony만의 열정을 보여주고 있다.

‘JUMP (English Version)’ is the English version of ‘JUMP’, the title track of P1Harmony 6th Mini Album ‘HARMONY : ALL IN’. This track is a dance music in the alternative pop genre with a hip-hop based sound. The unique rap composition and the chorus that reverses to 8-beat give it a distinctive vibe.

#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #JUMP",49278,9107,460,2023-06-09T04:00:30Z,"Any Canadian kpop fans and to all kpop fans all over the world listening to this, lets get our radio stations (this including university radio) to play this.  We can make a difference for these guys.  I will also be promoting this in the Facebook and Instagram groups I am in.  When in the park or at the beach or driving to at work, I am going to play this song. What I am going to, I hope others help the same way.  We can do this...... saying stop sleeping on these guys, HELP. ADD OTHER SUGGESTIONS TO HELP PROMOTE THEM. I AM SICK T0 DEATH OF THE PEZ KPOP STANDEMIC.  Pez is a machine that pops out candies on after another, just like agencies with kpop groups. STANDEMIC is awful and doesn’t respect music.  Stan well know short for STalker fAN is toxic and disrespectful. No one says you can&#39;t have a favorite group or singer.  Its toxic and disrespectful when that is all you listen to or care to promote.  I promote many groups.  I respect true talent rare gifts the most.  Kpop has not been kind to those group&#39;s forced into disbandment. Many had to get part time jobs to eat because STAN was for one group and so agencies did nothing for those groups and they were not given any more chances.
I really waiting for official instrumental 😢
Me having both versions on loop cause I can&#39;t choose one. P1H is so talented

There aren&#39;t many English versions of K-pop songs (that I&#39;ve heard) that doesn&#39;t sound awkward and cringey. This is actually impressive, real good. Piwon, you&#39;re doing really well! Your songs are bop, fr. You&#39;re gaining more fans day-by-day and I believe that someday, even more people will see your talent. Fighting!

Ramadan - Lyrics:

You lift me up high
You spread my wings 
And fly me to the sky
I feel so alive
It's like my soul thrives in your light
But how I wish you'd be
Here with me all year around

Chorus: 
Ramadan Ramadan,
Ramadanu ya habib
(Ramadan, Ramadan, 
Ramadan O beloved)
Ramadan Ramadan 
Laytaka dawman qareeb
(Ramadan, Ramadan, 
How I wish you were always near)

Love is everywhere
So much peace fills up the air
Ramadan month of the Quran
I feel it inside of me, strengthening my Iman
But how I wish you'd be
Here with me all year around

Chorus

I just love the way you make me feel
Every time you come around you breathe life into my soul
And I promise that
I'll try throughout the year
To keep your spirit alive
In my heart it never dies
Oh Ramadan!

Fight Song - Eve (ENGLISH Cover) Chainsaw Man ED 12 | ファイトソング,"Fight Song / Eve【English Cover】ファイトソング
- 
I sang an English Cover of Fight Song, by Eve! It was used as Chainsaw Man Ending 12, but also a continuation to Eve's ""How to Eat Life"", telling a story about second chances, moving on, and walking away from a life lived with closed eyes.

Big shoutout to @EveExplained for helping me analyze this song and MV so that I could create a great lyrical adaptation! Watch her analysis of Fight Song- Eve Music Video here:

Lyrics

This game of life's a fight, I'm on the board and I can't rest until I make it alive

I wish that I could find a way to ease the pain that eats away at me every night

They take and take until they get their HEYDAY
Can't say a thing, unless you want a MAYDAY
And nothing will ever change,
My thoughts fade to a RA-TA-TA-TA-TA

But if all of the nonsense you've
Been promising's a lie to cheat me out of my dreams
I swear that I won't sleep until you've tasted the rage that I've caged and carried inside of me

Living life at your side, come lean on me when you like
In the dark of the night, I hear a call in my mind
And no matter what I try,
I'm haunted by the life I left behind 

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make

The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living, 
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel til the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, our fight song

Came back from the brink of death
Never going down easy, we're swinging on as long as we live
No pain, no gain, that's the game and that's way we play, so take my hand and we'll take it away

Can't help the way I raise trouble each day
Living on the edge, but really what can I say
I'll still be a dead man someday
But the grave's gonna have to fight for me

I locked my heart away
So I could keep it safe from love and pain, but something has changed 
Looks like it's SHOWTIME, ey?
I've got nothing to lose, so I'll swing away with all of my rage

In the cage, I fight for meaningless praise
I'm at the top, so let me hear you say yay
I wanna be free, I pray
But in the end, it's all the same thing

Gloves are off, eyes are burning
So let's go, I'll give you a show

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make
The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living, 
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel til the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, our fight song",531637,18081,752,2023-01-25T22:00:09Z,"Thank you so much for watching 💙<br>OUT NOW on Spotify- <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/TrickleYT"">https://tinyurl.com/TrickleYT</a><br>- Subscribe or I&#39;ll eat you ヽ(`⌒´メ)ノ

Wait, i just found out fight song is the ending of chainsaw man (i watched it months ago)
Watching trickle cured my sickness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am now immortal.
What is that anime i want to see
Honestly, this is my prefered version from this song by far, it even exceeds the original for me.<br>I am still stunned by how good you covered this
🔥🔥
the subtitles placement is underrated, specially in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a>
Este es mi cover favorito en inglés
damn- thats the first time ive ever actually really enjoyed an English cover of really any song- props to you man!
아 미치겠다 뭐라 말을 하고싶은데 표현할 단어가 떠오르질 않아요......... 진짜 사실 Eve님이신거 아니죠?????? 아니면 어떻게 이렇게 비슷하게 아니 와 아
凄い！声質似すぎ
All my life i have been thinking that there&#39;s not a single cover that is made good enough to be at the same level as the original<br><br>You did prove me wrong<br>And not with just this one<br>All your covers are amazing
Pls do kaikai kitan 🙏😊
Normaly i dont like covers of songs<br>But this one is a banger and is very fiting to the song
I&#39;mma cheer on and on for this Fight Song!
Ok geez
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=0m13s"">0:13</a>
The cover is amazing❤
Jesus omg i thought this was Japanese you were speaking you sound a lot like eve
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a> bro that addon had me dying I love it
LMFAO THE <br>ME:<br>YOU IF YOU DONT SUBSCRIBE<br>seriously tho i wasnt focusing when i clicked on this and i was like wait is that english why does it sound so similar to the original and just wtfed the whole video thru.
&quot;I&#39;ll still be a dead man someday<br>But the grave&#39;s gonna have to fight for me&quot;<br>Damn. My favorite line.
SUBSCRIBE OR ILL BEAT YOU SENSELESS
Fantastic cover. Would love an official version/collab with Eve. Really good work!
Metal gear vibes on this line: <br>Tobi - &#39;&#39;The fight is on let&#39;s dance&#39;&#39;<br>Sam - &#39;&#39;Let&#39;s dance&#39;&#39;
It’s a great song, but did this guy just make up all new lyrics? The english translation of the original Japanese lyrics that appear in the original music video aren’t even close to what this guy is saying.
I put this cover into my youtube music album a month ago and now I realize you are not Eve
I will speak in my homeland<br><br>QUE PIKA VEI NAMORAL MANO MUITO LINDOOOOOOOOOO
Lol it’s still sounds like the original well kinda...
Honestly eve should make an actual anime, id watch all of it
THIS SONG IS W AND THIS DUDE GOT BARS!!!
Your voice like Eve&#39;s voice
Trickle my super awesome dude I just started listening to your covers and I&#39;m addicted! Your&#39;e so gifted!!! All of these covers are SO GOOD!!! Thanks for blessing us with your voice!
Что это за аниме?
I was literaly so confused about what i heard, cause I expected a Cover of fight song and it sounds so much like the original, that I scrolled  down from full screen to check if I&#39;m on the right tab on my Browser XD<br>How, like Shiro would say: &quot;Omega Good Job!&quot; :3
Top 10 covers that were better than the original... Number 1:
I&#39;m in love with this song  ❤️‍🔥🫠👍
Your voice is literally perfect
<b>THE RHYTHM.</b><br><b>THE VOICE.</b><br><br>You&#39;re the first I&#39;ve seen to sing the lyrics in English like how Japanese sounds (sounds are shorter and syllables are more compact and don&#39;t blend).<br>Can&#39;t wait to see you at the top one day.
This cover is so amazing! Good job, Trickle! Also, you may never read this but I have a suggestion for another cover, even though you&#39;re probably busy. Do you think you could do a song like Mirage or Melty Land Nightmare by Harumaki Gohan? Your voice would be fitting for songs like those. :)
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m47s"">2:47</a> I can&#39;t XD
LOL <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a>
I still don&#39;t and can&#39;t understant how you sing so perfectly
Woooooooow no words left to say.. ur perfect.... Love ur voice....

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUzrEVkR14&amp;t=1m28s"">1:28</a> bro was like yeet the child
this cover fire!
Fight Song is my favourite Eve song.<br>And this cover is amazing! ✨<br>Great Job!"

Jesus is my happyest
Hahahaha...no. In what world is this motivation to get stronger? Where&#39;s the Slipknot, Marylin Manson, Korn, Eminem, AC/DC, 90s wrestling enterance music, GG Allin, etc? This is weak ass sauce
Shelf motivation <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/oRxsFBGg6Q8?feature=share"">https://youtube.com/shorts/oRxsFBGg6Q8?feature=share</a>
ziaaa
No pain, no gain, Shut up and train<br>Your body can stand almost anything,It’s your mind that you have to convince<br>Definition of a really good workout: when you hate doing it, but you love finishing it<br>Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going<br>70% of people that start a fitness plan quit. Except you. Not this time
Good Mix, Workout Tym
This song has potential to motivate extremely....increased my pushupps to 40💪💪🎵

Thank you . Please explain songs from also OneRepublic
Thanks brother from myanmar.<br>I gave subscription for your video and waiting for other videos. ❤️❤️❤️

Do you guys have any App on playstore?
5th May 2023 here❤
Sir I am from India, Tamilnadu. I was weak in speaking English. How to speak English fluently?.I face many struggle to facing English.  Please share the tips .
L
Really if you don&#39;t have a lot of options only a single option is here then you have to work on it to achieve your goal
You are the best teacher ☺️❤️<br>Love from india😁
interesting choices. I use songs for esl. Many ways to do it. I&#39;d suggest letting the entire song play at least once to the end. Then explain expressions,etc., or the other way around, explain , and then let it play the entire song, and have them sing with it, karaoke style. Also, nice having the names of the songs, but would be nice putting names of artist. Having taught esl a long time, don&#39;t expect everyone will understand what you&#39;re saying, especially speaking fast.<br>Personal choice, but  don&#39;t think teaching contractions is the best.
Unstoppable 🔥&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Yeah i think me either 🤔 😅 😕
I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;ll learn to speak from this video. But I will definitely learn to listen to different kinds of songs.
Please make a video on learning English with money heist a popular series I would love that

"Sun Maahi (English Version) - Armaan Malik, Amaal Mallik | Always Music Global","#SunMaahi is a very special song for me and my imprint Always Music Global. The outpour of love on the track has been so overwhelming and owing to this response from all my fans and listeners, we have put together an EP titled ‘Sun Maahi - The EP’ which features a brand-new English version of the track and a LoFi mix alongside the original Hindi track and an instrumental. I truly believe this song has a lot of unexplored colours and possibilities and I wanted to bring it to life with these two new versions. Hope that you all enjoy it and that these new tracks make you fall in love with the song even more.

Lyrics:
I stood atop the board, all while the pain is piercing deep, just like a stinging, old thorn
Frustration’s one true form should be the state of mind I wanna see as a dream I adore
Spinning ‘round for always, yet another heyday
If that’s what I’d say, it would be a mayday
Although I may grow and age, still my head aches, going rattattatta

Now, if only your nonsense seemed like they’re words that rob the views, so false in all their beliefs
Revenge has truly seethed within its one true form in the lungs and with the lead I feel deep
Living on with this one life and I’m holding on tight
I’m drunk and high on impulse and drive
Although I may feel disguised, if there’s a place where I belong and can fight

Let us show all our dreams in dark nights, refusing to die

Let’s run and make a break for the future that we take
To death, for which we all pray
And surrender to a great rage
Go be calm and one with time
There’s a boy with a promise inside
For today, just like a past life
With no future in sight

Come and let your voice shout loud
Let’s take it easy right now
No common sense to be found
We only know the world through eyes, so wise, without a doubt
They overflow, these feelings I behold
And just like a show, applaud me when I go

The true form a comeback takes with the words with which we’re raised from the depths of our pain
The ache, the blaze like a flame, there isn’t any place I can escape, and even the same
Even now, we make ourselves fools that all play
It feels so great to pave a simple dream’s ways
Although I may drop dead one day, it’s okay, it’s like a boring joke I’d say 

The form of love is like a little hell in which you’re lost without hurting inside
The better showtime thrives when there is nothing left to lose deep within your own mind
Bowing down to pride, so stupid and blind
The best I find, cling upon it and rise
Just as it was that time, I wanted just a normal, plain life

With those eyes that are rusted in this light, let’s see where you lie

Let us show all our dreams in dark nights, refusing to die

Let’s run and make a break for the future that we take
To death, for which we all pray
And surrender to a great rage
Go be calm and one with time
There’s a boy with a promise inside
For today, just like a past life
With no future in sight

Come and let your voice shout loud
Let’s take it easy right now
No common sense to be found
We only know the world through eyes, so wise, without a doubt
They overflow, these feelings I behold
And just like a show, applaud me when I go",842661,21934,453,2023-01-29T17:00:06Z,"STREAM THIS ON SPOTIFY HERE!!! <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/chainsaw-heart"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/chainsaw-heart</a><br>long awaited and heavily anticipated, i finally sang another Eve song!! maybe more to come, im starting to like him a lot... enjoy &amp; if eve sees this ily
wowwwwwwww.. i never liked english covers yooo.. you make me discover that it can be possible
я влюбилась в ваш голос
I cannot stress how good this cover is
The sentient duffel bag is a neat concept
Just listed to this for the last concert of my school year
I remember how i wasn&#39;t interested in all the chainsaw man covers till my sibling showed me In the Back Room, then i watched Cerebral rendezvouz, and then this one. I literally, ALMOST CRIED.
Who else noticed that some of the lyrics were wrong😥
これ翻訳すると何て言ってるんだろ。気になりすぎて寝れん
what show is this????!!!
The guy really feels the music, whatever I turn on his voice is suited for anything….
Eve never misses
This song make&#39;s me want to be strong 😤😤😤
This is a banger. The music video reminds me of kill la kill.
What anime or manga is this?
Omg I have been looking for an English cover of this then I found this video!!! Thank you very much
ngl the animation should be made into a anime show or movie
This guy really went &quot;Where the f*ck is my child?&quot; <b>murderous eyes</b>
This is not only the most accurate English translation of this song... It&#39;s also the Best!! I don&#39;t usually add song covers to my Spotify lists, especially English covers, but this..!! this is different.!
Is it anime or just animation?
I applaud you as you go.
Müq
this isnt chainsaw man? is it?!
oh my gosh, my first time seeing eve song rhyme in english
Anime what is it called?
The only fight here is me against the urge to get ripped
did this man seriously skipped chainsaw man ed 3. no dignity.<br><br>jokes aside this is really awesome like always. but i still wanted to see the 3rd ending
is this an anime?? or us it just animated for this video?
получилось прикольно, жаль только качество съел и мелодию испортил :(
Pain is piercing sounds like penis pissing and no I’m not sorry
Can you do a cover for how to eat life
Uh uh your voice is lower but not as high as <b>****</b>
I&#39;m happy to hear my favorite song in English！！( *⁠´⁠꒳`  )
Name of the series used in the video
yeah
And then there&#39;s me who didn&#39;t know this song was in chainsaw man
As someone who loves eve. AHHHHHHHHHH /pos
超かっこいい〜っ！！<br>NICE English cover!!👏✨
Goosebumps, DAMN! I love this
^^
Your telling me this isn&#39;t it&#39;s own anime
sorry im late i was drooling looking at tobi
NOW DO HOW TO EAT LIFE IT&#39;S A PREQUAL
They should seriously make an anime out of this
Gah demn nice voice bro
What  anime is it about
I haven&#39;t stop listening to this ever since last week this is just so good, hope you will and do create the English version of eien hanahadashii by shishishishi
Что за аниме !?!!?!

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no, uh
You need to let it go, uh, you need to let it go, uh
Need to let it go, uh
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no (Woo), my number is no
You need to let it go, uh, you need to let it go, uh
Need to let it go, uh
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Verse 1]
First you gonna say you ain't runnin' game
Thinkin' I'm believing every word
Call me beautiful, so original
Telling me I'm not like other girls
I was in my zone before you came along
Now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
All my ladies, listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl, all you gotta say is

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no, uh
You need to let it go, uh, you need to let it go, uh
Need to let it go, uh
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Thank you in advance, I don't wanna dance (Nope)
I don't need your hands all over me (No, no)
If I want a man, then I'ma get a man
But it's never my priority (Hey)
I was in my zone, before you came along
Don't want you to take this personal
Blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
All my ladies, listen up (All my ladies)
If that boy ain't giving up (Ain’t giving’ up)
Lick your lips and swing your hips (Hey, hey, let's go!)
Girl, all you gotta say is (Woo)

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no, uh
You need to let it go, uh, you need to let it go, uh
Need to let it go, uh
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Bridge]
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
Uh, I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling, nah to the ah to the no, no, no (Hey, hey, hey)
Sing it, untouchable, untouchable (I'm feeling)
Uh, I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable (Untouchable)
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling, nah to the ah to the no, no, no, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
All my ladies, listen up (Say, all my ladies)
If that boy ain't giving up (Ain't giving up)
Lick your lips and swing your hips (No, no)
Girl all you gotta say is (No, no)

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no (Hey, oh-oh)
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go (Baby)
Need to let it go

Why did a bunch of songs dissapear from youtube music?<br>Even your cover of Mukanjyo dissapeared
Help I was singing along with her😂
Who is the white haired lady? Never seen her
This song is very good in both versions ❤❤❤❤❤
Love this
NO WONDER THEY CHOSE THIS SONG I GET IT
Ever think about the songs from the Ikki Tousen series? I think it would be awesome to hear those songs in english. Like Driving Though the Night, Heart &amp; Soul, No x Limit, and whatever else is on the list. Although I personally enjoy Garasu no Hana.
What the hell I’ve been listening to other versions for ages same intro different translations
this is so good its equally good with the og it&#39;s a bop
I&#39;m listening to this today and I have to say AmaLee sounds so much like LiSa. i love both their vocals .
Boom😚
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Japanese is better
Hi AMaLee my name is Andrew. I am a big fan of your work and your voice acting is so super awesome you totally rule :D AMALEE :D &lt;3
It&#39;s 2023 😂😅😊 it&#39;s still a masterpiece.
As a huge fan of Demon Slayer, finally having a English version makes me feel happy 🥲Continue Doing What You Do!
Thanks because I was trying to sing this in japenese
What&#39;s the breath style of that female demon slayer character? Tbh she looks like a fodder demon slayer npc.
say what you want but the english and japanese are fire and her voice definetly matches the japanese&#39;s version
&quot;Finally you&#39;ve given me a reason to be strong, And we&#39;ll stand hand in hand to the end.&quot; Eighteen words, eighteen simple words that sums up the entire story of Demon Slayer. The story of the Kamado siblings, so incredibly loyal to each other. Tanjiro NEVER gave up on Nezuko, and Nezuko KNEW that her place was at her brother&#39;s side. It was a long road, full of death and pain. But they stayed together through it all, and they walked that road with loyal if somewhat quirky friends. Zenitsu, the would be coward who became a legitimate hero and the man Tanjiro would one day call his brother in law. Inosuke, despite his brutish demeanor at first, would become one of the most loyal companions anyone could have. Tanjiro&#39;s greatest strength was his empathy for others. This earned him the respect of his fellow Slayers, and the love of Kanao, the woman who would become his wife. All of it started because Tanjiro would not give up on Nezuko, they were each other&#39;s reason for living and they earned their happy ending. A lesson we all can learn from. Family matters, even if you don&#39;t always get along with them. True friends are more valuable than silver, gold, or platinum. So treasure them as such.
I’ve been wondering<br>The English version like what is it in English the demon slayer theme song <br>And finally you did it I’ve been wondering, almost this whole month and last month 😂
1. Finally you have given me a reason to be strong.<br>2.This world can beat me down hundred times but into light i always rise<br>The above two are the perfect line for the song because it&#39;s shows the whole personality of Tanjiro(Demon Slayer MC)<br>In line 1 he get a reason to strong for save his sister and in the second line show no matter how many times tanjiro damaged in battle but he always stand up to protect people and his sister and friends ( Thats why i love the Tanjiro as a Main Character) <br>And in my opinion Tanjiro is one of the best MC in an anime he is really a kind hearted man and i believe nobody able to hate him
Sick song
did you actually sing this??? if you did u have a great voice!
can u pls do season 3 opening of demon slayer Man on a misson x millet
GO OFF QUEEN
The intro of my life
Why the fuck r u in it tho

&quot;The dream I tried but couldn&#39;t bring to life&quot;    &quot;They&#39;re rooted deep in my heart, that&#39;s where they&#39;ll remain&quot;    &quot; I&#39;ll let them grow wild, in my veins. &quot;

'Causе her friends go dey gum her like chewing gum, woah (Mhmm)
Go dey gum her like chewing gum, oh-woah

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Yeah, I know I look shy but for you I get down, oh, woah
And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you (Yeah)
Do it once, do it twice (Do it twice)
I push back, you hold me tight
Get a taste for a night

[Chorus: Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez & Rema]
Baby show me you can calm down, calm down
Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now (Lead now)
Got you so high that you can't come down, come down
Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed (Oh, no)
When it's you, I can't say no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Wanna give you it all but can't promise that I'll stay
And that's the risk you take (You take)

[Chorus: Rema, Rema & Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez]

Thanks a lot ✊🏽
Boa nova eu .Paulo escolhi esta imagem que foi gravado nas minhas mãos o caminho da salvação dado pelo pai que é deus já que muitos dizem que sabem ler a cronologia das linhas das mãos não se esqueçam todos estão marcados por deus nas vossas mãos o destino escolhem bem o vosso caminho para não se perderem na tentação porque o poder não chega à salvação da alma um grande abraço ao povo de deus ❤
GOD works in mysterious ways, using music to reach the world the same method the devil tries to use. <br><br>This prayer song has been played in clubs around the world, and I&#39;m glad the lyrics didn&#39;t come out until it was already viral.
May i get the English translation for the lyrica pleeease and thank you! I looove this aong so so so much. Brings peace and calmness to this chaotic lifestyle we live in Alaska.❤
Fast and furious... gone in 60 seconds 😰☠😈👹
All created equally
Jerusalem is our heavenly mother
Before I knew what they were saying, i felt the song speaks to spirit...Hallelujah!  Absolutely beautiful...
Awesome God ride on King Jesus!!!

My first time hearing this song I made him play it again without knowing the lyrics. It just grabbed my soul and now I understand why 😢
Моя душа поет с этой песней.

The song is a beautiful prayer song but to be dancing  with it becuz of the tempo..I gues its inappropriate  with all food and drinks in their hands....Improper way of praying....the prayer song became  fun / dancing ..?? <br><br>I NEVER REALIZED  THE SONG IS TOTALLY PRAYER DIRECTED TO OUR LORD GOD..<br>JERUSALEMA [Jerusalem has 2 meanings in Hebrew: [ Yerushalayim] <br>Yireh..Jireh..GOD PROVIDES  and <br>[Yireh Shalem or Shalom] .God of<br>Peace..<br>...UNTIL TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH ..now I know BUT IT is PRAYER.<br>It Means Jerusalem  is my home..Guard me, guide me to my home...to your kingdom...Jerusalem<br>It&#39;s a worship song.Yet almost all are dancing to its Tempo...there&#39;s No more Reverence to God by al the dancing WITH that beautiful music.other videos dancers..WITH FOOD AND DRINKS  IN THEIR HANDS.. ITS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE..<br>WRONG WAY TO USE  THAT VERY NICE WORSHIP / PRAYER SONG TO THE LORD..<br><br>Sorry guys: That why we need to know the Word of God!<br>Its has becone a Worldly pattern...<br><br>&quot; And do not be conformed to this world [any longer with its superficial values and customs], but be transformed and progressively changed [as you mature Spiritually] by the renewing of your mind [focusing on Godly values and ethical attitudes], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what the Will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His plan and purpose for you].<br>Romans 12:2 AMP
God in heaven and through Jesus&#39;Christ is  My Master
And what if he cannot beat Spiritual ah 🤣 bow you not Master
I call no man a Master
Then you Jehova
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

And Westerners have to put a religious spin on this when it has nothing to do with religion lmao
I. Love. It
Love for you all❤
I&#39;m blessed to have this music make me feel our lord and savior blessings to all my human nature stay up stay blessed 🙏
I am French 🇫🇷 and this song was and still is one of my favourites, I listened to it when I was with my family or with my friends and we were just all vibing to it ❤️<br>I was so happy when I saw that people from many different countries danced on it, this world needed it, I wish there was no more wars, and that there was more peace in this world 🌎☮️<br>Love from France! ✨❤️
🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song I am from the Garden of Eden  ( South Sudan 🇸🇸) .
Hallelujah.Cảm ơn Chúa đã cho con được làm con của Ngài.Cha của chúng con hơn cả tuyệt vời.Vinh hiển danh Ngài trên các từng Trời.A Men.
I think we forgive ourselves first and forgive others because God is forgiven sins. I really love this song because Jerusalem is a sacredly place and where Jesus Christ was born. ❤
I am so pleased I found this video, the lyrics translated are perfect and they are wonderful"

"After A While, Crocodile | + More Super Simple Songs for Kids","More great Super Simple videos in the Super Simple App for iOS ► http://apple.co/2nW5hPd

Hi there! Yeah, you ^_^.  Thanks for watching! We're happy to share this collection of kids songs and nursery rhymes, starting off with a super simple goodbye song, ""After A While, Crocodile."" Let us know what you think in the comments ^_^. 

In case you're wondering, here's a little bit of information about the differences between alligators and crocodiles: 
- Alligators have u-shaped snouts.
- Crocodiles have more v-shaped snouts.
- Alligators' upper teeth often show when the mouth is closed.
- Crocodiles' upper and lower teeth show when the mouth is closed.
- Alligators generally live in fresh water.
- Crocodiles generally live in salt water or water that is brackish (has more salt than typical fresh water.)
-Neither make very good pets!

I&#39;m recently learning Spanish and I searched up the English lyrics of this song for studying and gaining some more knowledge in Spanish but now I&#39;m traumatized 🙂
When you’re not a native Spanish speaker, and you find out the English lyrics to this, but you still proceeded to listen to it and jam out as much as you have a floor even though you know what it actually means you still second in Spanish anyway
Me as an American and after learning the lyrics: 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😳😳😳😳😳🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 And im gonna tell my teacher to stop play this song in front of 9 year olds 💀

▶ Lyrics Bizarrap

Bizarrap & Shakira - 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53': English Translation
INTRO
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Sorry, I already took another plane
I'm not coming back here, I don't want another disappointment
So much that you pretend to be a champion
And when I needed you, you gave your worst version
Sorry, baby, it's been a while
I should have thrown that cat away
A she-wolf like me ain't for a rookie

CHORUS
A she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 1
I do this for you to mortify, chew and swallow, swallow and chew
I'm not coming back to you, even if you're crying or begging
I understood that it's not my fault you're criticized
I only make music, I'm sorry I splashed you
You left me as a neighbour to the mother-in-law
With the press at the door and the debt at the IRS
You thought you'd hurt me, but you made me tougher
Women don't cry anymore, women invoice

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like
He's got a good person's name
Clearly

CHORUS
She's just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with one just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 2
From love to hate, there's only one step
This way don't come back, listen to me
No hard feelings, baby, I wish you the best with my supposed replacement
I don't even know what happened to you
You're so weird that I can't even tell you apart
I'm worth two 22's
You traded a Ferrari for a Twingo
You traded a Rolex for a Casio
You're going fast, slow down
Ah, a lot of gym
But workout your brain a little too
Pictures wherever I am
I feel like a hostage here, it's all right with me
I'll let you go tomorrow and if you want to bring her along, bring her along too

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

CHORUS
And a she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

OUTRO
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

Lyrics:
Marinette/Ladybug:
On the day time
I'm Marinette
Just a normal girl
With a normal life
But there's something about me
That no one knows yet
Cause I have secret
Another day,
I'm back at school
I think about him, he's so cool
He looks at me, I look away
But does he see me anyway
Oh, Oh, Oh
He's got me spinning round
Oh, Oh, Oh
My feet are off the ground
Oh, Oh, Oh
And when the sun goes down
That's when I become
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test, when things go wrong
Miraculous!
The luckiest!
The power of love, always so strong!
Adrien/Cat Noir:
I am a cat, just chilling out
But in the night, she's all I think about
I feel so strong, when she's around
She picks me up, when I am down
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh no you'll never know!
Oh, Oh, Oh
My love can only grow
Oh, Oh, Oh
And when I see her smile
That's when she becomes
Marinette/Ladybug:
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test, when things go wrong!
Marinette (Adrien):
Miraculous! (Miraculous!)
The luckiest! (Oh Oh)
The power of love, always so strong!
Marinette/Ladybug:
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test when things go wrong!
Miraculous!
The luckiest!
The power of love, always so strong!
Miraculous!
Simply the best!
Up to the test, when things go wrong!
Miraculous!

The power of love, always so strong!

Lyrics:
First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

IN CHRIST ALONE MY HOPE IS FOUND
HE IS MY LIGHT MY STRENGTH MY SONG
THIS CORNERSTONE THIS SOLID GROUND
FIRM THROUGH THE FIERCEST DROUGHT AND STORM
WHAT HEIGHTS OF LOVE WHAT DEPTHS OF PEACE
WHEN FEARS ARE STILLED WHEN STRIVINGS CEASE
MY COMFORTER MY ALL IN ALL
HERE IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST I STAND


בן אלוהים לבש בשר
THE SON OF GOD CAME IN FLESH
מלוא אלוהות בגוף אדם
FULL DIVINITY IN HUMAN BODY
מתנת צדקה ואהבה
A GIFT OF JUSTICE AND LOVE
חייו הוא נתן ככפרה
HE GAVE HIS LIFE AS A RANSOM


ذاقَ العنا عَنّا قَضى
HE SUFFERED AND DIED FOR US
فيهِ اكتَفى حُكمُ الإِله
IN HIM GOD'S JUDGMENT WAS FULFILLED
شالَ الخَطا عَنّي غَدا
HE TOOK MY SIN
في مَوتِهِ لِيَ حَياة
IN HIS DEATH I HAVE LIFE
في ظُلمَةِ القَبرِ ثَوى
HE STAYED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE GRAVE
مَع أَنَّهُ نورُ الحَياة
THOUGH HE IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE
وَقامَ هازِمًا قِوى
AND HE ROSE AND DEFEATED
المَوتِ الرَّهيبِ بِقِواه
THE TERRIBLE DEATH WITH HIS STRENGTH


בניצחון עומד עתה
NOW HE STANDS IN VICTORY
קללת החטא נוצחה הוסרה
THE CURSE OF SIN WAS DEFEATED AND REMOVED
אני שלו והוא שלי
I'M HIS AND HE IS MINE
נקניתי בדם פודי ישעי
I WAS BOUGHT WITH THE BLOOD OF MY SAVIOR


NO GUILT IN LIFE NO FEAR IN DEATH
THIS IS THE POWER OF CHRIST IN ME


ריבון עולם
WORLD SOVEREIGN
אשא עיני
I LIFT MY EYES
כי בידיך עיתותיי
BECAUSE MY TIMES ARE IN YOUR HANDS


نيرُ الخَطا وَلَعنَتُه
THE YOKE AND CURSE OF SIN
زالا بِفَضلِ غَلبَتِه
WERE REMOVED DUE TO HIS VICTORY

Thank you, God&#39;s Testimony is defiantly breathing in me. I&#39;m part of the Tribe of David and I am indeed one of the children of Israel from Operation Israel. The best way to Bless Israel is Jehova Jiren, the Great I am, The Adonia, Abbah, Father. I&#39;ve survived my own genocide based on  me looking &#39;different&#39; from other people, but I meditate on the god&#39;s word both day and night without ceasing. The prophecy of Ezekiel has indeed been fullfilled through Christians. I am one of the remenant, and I wouldn&#39;t ask god to be reborn as a white person. I stand as a Lamb of God, as a Warrior Women, and believe strongly in the promises of Redemption by god. He created the tribes and the people there-of. Many people don&#39;t believe i&#39;m jewish when they look at me, because I don&#39;t fit the &#39;typical&#39; image of what a jewish person looks like. My yiddish is a little bit crusty but my arabic is coming along a little bit.<br><br>Praise be to the Lord God All-Mighty, I am indeed, from the tribe of David. God is my machine in technology, I give him all the glory, the honor, and the power. Praise be our god on high. My my native brothers and sisters also turn from their ways and go towards the light, that light is Jesus the Christ, the great I am! I&#39;ve been SA 3 times, almost killed 7 times, but yet I still am for God regardless. I fed 10,000 people to people long ago, but I&#39;m not stupid. The problem was the wrong people tried to take me down but I refuse to back down. I am of a true Royal Priesthood and I am indeed belong to the Lord God All-mighty, including those that are true christians in Technology as well too. I fought against the system in this world and I still do, regardless. My focus is razor sharp and I am keen to small details. In other words, God shall use me mightly!!
“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in Heaven. <br><br>Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ <br>And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; <br>Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ <br>- Matthew 7:21-23<br><br>“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, <br>so it will be at the end of the age. <br>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes s1n <br>and all who do evil. <br>They will throw them into the blazing furnace, <br>where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot; <br>- Matthew 13:40-42
God bless in all faiths and none joseph
I saw your in-feed ad around midnight, wondered what it was about and clicked it, and now play your songs on repeat. So heavenly.

Brought me to tears at the first note. 🙌🙌🙌

Karol G & Shakira - TQG // English Translation,"Karol G, Shakira - TQG (Mañana será bonito, 2023) English Subs/Lyrics

Lyrics:
[Letra de ""TQG""]

[Intro: KAROL G]
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' (No; papi)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte (Ah)
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

[Coro: Shakira & KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al menos yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verso 3: Shakira & KAROL G]
Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más leve
Volver contigo never, tú eres la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

[Coro: KAROL G & Shakira]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito
[Outro: KAROL G]

This song works so well with Shakira <br>Yassss 🎉❤😊<br><br>Ty lord for Eng subs ^_^
Absolutely love this! Both of them did such a amazing job with this 🔥🔥
They hit the mark with the beat but the dancing and lyrics are weak
I am so tired... Of her complaining at him. Bad things happen to all people. She needs to accept it and gracefully move forward. With  love 🌷
Así es ... Latin power... fuck tramposos, una mujer vale oro y no la valoran
The hardest diss track ever created

The Best
Great mix of music. Upbeat constantly and continuous flow.
Yeaaaa!!
How can I listen to this at the gym without taking my phone into the gym. I have ear buds but not sure if it would help
This was the weakest puss mix I’ve heard in a long time.
You don&#39;t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. 🙌🏋‍♀💪
I always listening this music,every morning 🤗

Work out mode bro.. always here basta work out mode.
Love the fact that it&#39;s not loaded with commercial content 👌.  Will continue to thumbs up and support the channel.  Music is appropriate for the work-out.
It&#39;s sad it&#39;s sad an artist like this is not on the top 100 billboards, that he&#39;s not out being broadcast for the world to see, this man&#39;s words are truly inspirational and I&#39;ve been listening to them for the last few days workout or not, I wake up and put this on we need more people that speak the truth like this,holla.
Great mix. How do you find the artist/song list if you don&#39;t have Spotify?

I love that Octavia and vyce are my mains and fave characters and both have my favorite songs so good!!❤
Rock at it&#39;s finest, this is fire!!!
I would <b>LOVE</b> an Easteregg of the vocals having a chance to kick in after right after Vyce / Octavia score a goal during a Set that has their theme playing.<br><br>Everyone would love it! ❤
Just started playing and instantly mained her amazing and i like her design alot
Love how the lyrics of Vyce&#39;s theme reflect her backstory in game! Going to be practicing her more in future games, that&#39;s for sure.
Not only the game is a banger but also the themes? It&#39;s insane how big of success this game is especially considering how simple the concept is. Well done guys!
Man I love this song so much, been listening on repeat since it&#39;s release! I love everything about Vyce, her design, her gameplay, everything!
Omega striker devs trying to not make a banger for 5 minutes( they failed)
It&#39;s f*cking awesome <b>~</b>
Why is every vocalist that I like being pulled into making music for Omega Strikers? Thats unfair for my heart
Oh maaan these are absolutely amazing!! Stop it guys (jk), I already love your game! I didn&#39;t think it as possible to love it even more! You&#39;ve done an amazing job so far and I can&#39;t wait to see what else you got in store for us ♥
I&#39;ve never heard of Nano before but this song is amazing and definitely made me want to check out more of their work! Absolutely amazing song probably my favourite of the entire soundtrack so far (but they all rock)
I like to think this is the song Octavia did hear when she gets to see her play. The fact that she would praise her after it means she gets it in some ways
Cool!
GO TEAM ROCK WOOOO
you don&#39;t know how happy it makes me to get full length songs for striker themes now, i hope it continues for future releases &lt;3
This music is so sick.<br>I have been listening on repeat to boost my gameplay !<br>The team really did an awesome work here , even more so with the lyrics after getting to know the characters lore.<br>I just loved it a lot! Thank you guys
Who is she talking about? Her sister Octavia, are they sisters?
this reminds me a ton of like old school Sonic music and I love it
I need this on Spotify ToT
I cannot get enough of this song, you can just FEEL the hard work and passion behind it, absolutely amazing, gosh i love this game...im already looking forward to whatever comes next.
Sorry if no one feels the same, but doesn’t this feel strait out of guilty gear strive or am I just weird?
I really love that the lore tidbits are short, but extremely sweet, and the music production with the lyrics and such really adds so, so, so much to the game despite the small size.<br><br>So I&#39;ll assume this song is before she and Octavia decides to get into Corestrike? such a lovely duo &lt;3
Man the music in this game absolutely kills it. I love how the MVP character&#39;s theme song plays when the game ends or after a round in competitive, really gets you hype, whetever it&#39;s your character&#39;s theme or a teammate&#39;s !<br>Looking forward to being able to listen to this in game during a match 🔥<br>TEAM VYCE FTW
God I could add every song from this game onto my vibe playlist, it&#39;s all so goooooooood!!!
this song is growing on me everytime it come on my recommended.
ゲーム内でもVocal付きで流れてくれないかなぁ<br>チーム内にオクタビアがいるときだけとか、2セット連続フラグトップとかの特殊演出でもいいから
The team behind these is great! They’ve released 2 entire songs, as well as 2 new characters in less then a month, and actually know how to properly make a community happy! The songs are bangers as well!! This is one of my new favourite games!
Had to animate it and give it a rave setting I wish I could go to<br><br>where are my local demon girl bands at T^T
Hmm so I like rock more than edm, Vyce more than Octavia, and this song more than Thousand Absolutes, wonder what I&#39;m gonna pick in the event
This is beyond a banger, this game deserves all the succes its gained and hoping for a hell of a lot more to come!
How is this so damn good?!
Why does this kinda sound like a song for her sister Octavia? All the parts talking about how she’s “not a shadow of you” and “showing you the story she wants to tell” just kinda screams that to me which works for her style of music huh 🤔
Man, Vyce quickly wormed her way into my heart with her design and gameplay, but her backstory and theme definitely helped even more! The Overdrive Oni deserves a hug!
Team rock  Let&#39;s go
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamrock"">#teamrock</a> lets show them that rock isn&#39;t the shadow of edm
This sounds not like some indi game but a banger anime op<br>Props to you and our bilingual queen
get  the pun? they are VYCE versa
Awesome guitar solo
This song is awesome
started to play this game a week ago, got blasted by the anime style intro. now this and the octavia songs dropped and they are absolute bangers. so glad i found this game &lt;3
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This makes me so hyped for the music festival event coming up. Great lore, great characters, i already know its gunna be a great event. This is easily the game of the summer! Keep up the amazing work 😎
damn this is incredible and will absolutely be adding it to my playlist lol makes me wish for divide music to do a song for OS
Damn this is really good no lie
how do i get the team emote ?
OH MY GOD i need this on spotify!!! pleeease pretty pleaseeee! such a sick song! Love ya NANO! and the whole Omega strikers team! great things you cooking right now ;)
This rocks🪨<br><br>Scratch that, <b>YOU GUYS ROCK!</b><br>🗿🤘
The excellence and competency of this team never ceases to amaze me"

✻ Lyrics ✻ (Feel free to use!)

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
When I waited for you underneath that blue sky
Passing by me in an instant
Slipping from the depths of my imagination
Hey, can somebody tell me what’ll happen next?
Say, tell me how to make it go on just another day
Looking right into your eyes
As I walk away_ from you one last time

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
All the summers that would bore me out of my mind
Didn’t I quit playing piano?
Out of habit tapping on my desk to play the notes
Hey, can somebody tell me what I’m gonna do?
“Hey, anything besides music should be okay”
Everything will be okay

If you took my heart and drew
A single note just straight on through
No it wouldn’t disappear believe me
Whatever I do it just won’t disappear
It’s still right here

But I’ve got it wrong again
I don’t understand
I don’t really care though
Not about music or truth or the world or this life I hold
I don’t really care, no!
Seeing things in black or white, isn’t right, it’s just an excuse right?
One thing’s for sure though
Everything is your fault

I’m suddenly taken back to that time
Growing old was the only thing on my mind
Knowing that someday I would die was like a stab in the chest, though I never understood why 
“Hey do you know what you’ll be doing one day?”
Passing by the years I knew what I would do one day
I’d be doing nothing at all

All your positivity, ignites a hatred deep in me
Knowing I’ll never be happy
Knowing that I’ll never be enough, can’t you see?
It haunts my every single waking dream

But I know you know I’m right
Though we’re different we’re humans deep inside
But without love, or salvation, or kindness, or comfort though, is it really life? no!
Crying when the radio plays a sappy note, pathetic yes I know
One thing’s for sure though
Everything is your fault

I’ve tried but I still don’t understand why
Why is it we have to fight to live our own life
Why I can’t live off doing the one thing I like
I don’t care if my lyrics aren’t quite right
I don’t really care, no

‘Cause I think I’ve got it right
Yeah I know I’ve got it right
Yeah I know I’ve got it right?

But I’ve got it wrong again
I don’t understand
I don’t really care though
Not about humans or truth or the world or this life I hold, I don’t really care, no!
Never giving a reply, just philosophic lines, is just an excuse right?
Not that I care tho
Everything is your fault

Even I had dreams long long ago
Now it doesn’t feel the same as it did before 
I’ve told you time and time again
It didn’t really matter if nothing came of it, you know
You do know, I know you know, now I can’t do it anymore

So now you know why
So now you know why I, don’t do music anymore

#rachie #yorushika #englishcover",606573,13458,329,2021-09-03T04:00:12Z,"Okay like, this song holds such a precious place in my heart for so many reasons and Rachies lyrics + voice really is the icing on the cake 💖<br><br><br>Like, the story of Amy and Elma is one I relate to dearly and it&#39;s one I reread every time I&#39;m back in a depressive episode<br>And this song perfectly encapsulats what excatly I love about the story <br>The depressingness of it but the sprinkle of hope in some parts 💖
歌も声も本当に素晴らしい！！<br>ヨルシカの「風邪を食む」を英語ver.で聞いてみたいです！！
Listening to this track is day ten.
YES OMG I DON&#39;T THINK I&#39;VE EVER SEEN A YORUSHIKA COVER I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Come on guys we should at least be happy she didn’t ACTUALLY give up on music
When my mental health was at it worst, I felt this song in a special way. Thank you for making this beautiful cover.
I don&#39;t know whether or not I want to pursue music since its been few years since I stopped singing... and stopped playing the guitar
I Love This Version ❤
The lyrics thoooo
this song gives me goodbye to rock you by tuyu vibes
🤍
This song hits me hard..
That’s cool！<br>Nice translate✨✨✨✨✨
&quot;Moonlight&quot;
It’s been a while since this has come out, but ever since I first heard this song, I realized I had chosen the wrong path of life by giving up on music. I always grew up with music in my veins and I thought I was going to go to university to become a professional pianist. I didn’t even make it a semester into a different major when I noticed I hated it and there was emptiness in my heart. I dropped everything and decided to pursue some skills that would help me where I want to get to be. I’ll be in a place of new opportunities shortly. It wouldn’t be without your talented cover Rachie! Thank you so much ❤️
I haven’t seen anyone here that has thought of this, nor do I think that anyone will see this, but I really relate this song to Omori. It’s like it describes the story of the game perfectly. It’s almost creepy lol. Seriously, though. “That’s Why I Gave Up On Music” sounds so similar to Sunny’s situation, honestly. He gave up on violin after what happened with Mari, and it describes how “everything is your fault.” It’s like how Sunny constantly blames himself for everything, for Mari’s death, for hurting his friends, for hating himself. It kind of sounds like that part is coming from how Sunny thinks Mari would talk to him, if she was still there with him. He thinks that she would blame her for everything that happened. So he gave up on music, locked it in a closet for 4 years and shut himself in his room.<br><br>“Everything will be okay” is just like, lmao idk how to say it?? It’s literally just “everything is going to be okay,” like what’s repeatedly forced and promised in the game, that everything’s gonna be okay. lol sorry i have a problem, i just really like this song and omori lololol ok bye
nice

とても素晴らしい🫠
二番サビ前の翻訳が綺麗すぎる
I keep getting tongue-tied trying to sing this XD
Why their is no lyrics in Spotify 😭😭😭
AAAAAAA KEREN BANGET KAK!!!
Nostalgia of a string of songs that narrates a story that I never quite understood because of it being in Japanese. All I&#39;ve got to say is that these lyrics are heavily underrated throughout the entirety of the album and am surprised on how little is said about them. Keep up the good work and your work in translations do not go unnoticed!
really good!
Hearing an english cover of this already beautiful song makes me want to keep writing songs with my guitar. Thank you for this cover, hearing you sing makes me look forward to sharing my own music in the future!
英語に翻訳してもヨルシカの雰囲気をここまで<br>再現できるのはめっちゃすごいと思う
This is so underrated. Im a new starting artist and sometimes I cant help to get mad at myself for not doing better than what I expected from myself. This song just makes it better somehow :)
Noce voice, so when you&#39;ll write your own song? Or any links of your own song/s?
bro if she quit music i aint quitting listening to the songs. but fr rachie we love you if you are actually  quitting have a good life.
baru tau kalau kamu dari indonesiaaaa karena dari video cover id:entity PLISSS <br><a href=""https://youtu.be/p_dNjVKttX4"">https://youtu.be/p_dNjVKttX4</a><br>AAAAAAAAAA
the emotion is conveyed so well
Could someone please elaborate what does the lyric &quot;Everything&#39;s your fault.&quot; mean? To whom is &#39;you&#39; referring???
there&#39;s this song and my r, i dont think im gonna get sick of either for a long time
I hope she caught the train... she&#39;s been waiting all day ;n;
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGqY5SQPvs8&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> pog
perhaps the reason why I cant seem to like that one person in my life is because i envy them for being able to make a living out of the things they love....<br>while i&#39;m giving up my only dream.. so that i can still exist in this world
You are literally my favourite coverer (lol I know that this word doesn&#39;t actually exist) you make the best vocaloid covers and your voice&#39;s pitch is perfectiooon<br>I have a suggestion! (please accept it if you can)<br>can you please make a cover for the song echo by crusherP?
Luckily i checked, cause this aint on your yorushika cover playlist
日本語でおk
can relate but instead of music its drawing....
I am literally crying while listening to your cover. This is so emotional.
:) I love this
This song almost made me cry but in a good way
Well it&#39;s been 2 and a half months. I&#39;ll miss these covers.
Noice
This song is a bop it&#39;s sad that Miss Rachie has given up on music hmm I&#39;m just gonna subscribe
wow poggers this video released on my moms birthday and i only realized it now"

🎤 Lyrics: FIFTY FIFTY - Cupid (Twin Version)

[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)

Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Break: All]
(Cupid is so dumb)

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb

Karol G & Shakira - TQG // English Translation,"Karol G, Shakira - TQG (Mañana será bonito, 2023) English Subs/Lyrics

Lyrics:
[Letra de ""TQG""]

[Intro: KAROL G]
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' (No; papi)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte (Ah)
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

[Coro: Shakira & KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al menos yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verso 3: Shakira & KAROL G]
Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más leve
Volver contigo never, tú eres la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

[Coro: KAROL G & Shakira]
Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito
[Outro: KAROL G]

Mi amor, es que usted se alejó mucho
Y yo de lejos ya no veo, bebé

This video is cropped so you can’t see their full body in the sexiest parts. Like when Blockbuster edited  out one of the sins in “Seven” with Pitt &amp; Paltrow. My video only had 6 sins. Lol.
What does tqg mean
She&#39;s legend of the year ❤
Thank you for this. I love this song. Kinda knew what it was about due to the media and my friends telling me. But this makes me experience this song fully. Thank you. 🐐
Do Shakira-Acróstico 🥲😍
So I&#39;ve been vibing to a song that&#39;s made by two chicks shit-talking to their ex? 😂 Oh god, the coping is real
Shakira&#39;s voice🔥
This song works so well with Shakira <br>Yassss 🎉❤😊<br><br>Ty lord for Eng subs ^_^
Absolutely love this! Both of them did such a amazing job with this 🔥🔥
They hit the mark with the beat but the dancing and lyrics are weak
I am so tired... Of her complaining at him. Bad things happen to all people. She needs to accept it and gracefully move forward. With  love 🌷
Así es ... Latin power... fuck tramposos, una mujer vale oro y no la valoran
The hardest diss track ever created

Por fin siento el placer de las personas que hablan inglés que tengan que usar subtitulos
Muchas gracias para el traduccion de inglés! Qué significa ‘TQG?’
I don&#39;t compete for men! Amen, gurls 🎉❤
❤ QUEENS
Many people don&#39;t realize at the end Shakira utter in a very deceptive way :  F***  You!....You all can  guess who she&#39;s referring about hehe
Las reinas❤🎉🎉🎉
She  just keeps burying him🤣🤣🤣🤣oh Pique by cheating on shakira u shat in ur mouth for the rest of ur life🤣🤣I can&#39;t wait for her next song
Hi, I speak Spanish. I&#39;m using a translator. I can&#39;t imagine how it feels to listen to a song in a different language than the one you speak. c:
Thank you for translating! ❤

Auf der heide bluht ein kleines blumelein<br><br>Und das heisst<br><br>Erika
France keep thinking it’s a peace song
Can’t lie I acctually enjoyed the song sounds like  something that soldiers kept to keep they spirits up
⚡⚡
France: ._.
VERY GOOD VIDEO
Why this Music is considered related to naz!sm?
I wish I spoke German
The Democrat’s anthem
This is like flor margarita by chalino  sanchez
Why did the Germans have to come up with a banger?
Me near my brother is comming in the room🤣
Wharhied ün heidat
Its a shame that this beutiful song was ruined by the nazis. Such a good song now associated with a very horrible event.
Why am I vibin to this shit😂😂💀💀🙏
On the health, there blooms a little flower. And its called, Erika. Eagerly a thousand hundred little bees, swam around, Erika

When you pause the video, but still hear the song: 🧿🧿<br>                                      👄
This song makes me feel like nazists were actually the good guys 😂😂😂😂
Anti Zionist Theme Song
German language 🤢 those lyrics doe 😂
Imma put this song as my ringtone.
Polish friend: <b>insults me</b><br>Me:
🙏🏻it’s time for the Germany 🇩🇪 free from tyranny of Boris’s administration, free form please🐄!
It’s my thought about the British and American governments are trying to blackmail the German first, from your economic crisis and the Escalation of the Russian conflict together with the Kosovo conflict to enlarge the War to the Western world 🌎 and leave Europe! How’s less cleverly Eu Heading!
My Führer this is the lyrics<br><br>Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika<br>Heiß von hunderttausend kleinen Bienelein<br>Wird umschwärmt<br>Erika<br>Denn ihr Herz ist voller Süßigkeit<br>Zarter Duft entströmt dem Blütenkleid<br>Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika<br>In der Heimat wohnt ein blondes Mägdelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika<br>Dieses Mädel ist mein treues Schätzelein<br>Und mein Glück<br>Erika<br>Wenn das Heidekraut rot-lila blüht<br>Singe ich zum Gruß ihr dieses Lied<br>Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika<br>In mein&#39;m Kämmerlein blüht auch ein Blümelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika<br>Schon beim Morgengrau&#39;n sowie beim Dämmerschein<br>Schaut&#39;s mich an<br>Erika<br>Und dann ist es mir, als spräch&#39; es laut<br>&quot;Denkst du auch an deine kleine Braut?&quot;<br>In der Heimat weint um dich ein Mägdelein<br>Und das heißt<br>Erika!

This song reminds me of the western part of Poland -👴
Rest In Peace to the 4 million brave men who never came home to their Erikas.
My hand:📈📈
🙏🏻❤please support our peace efforts please 🙏🏻.
Brings back the good old memorys when i was in the camps
I still can&#39;t understand why people are afraid of this music it&#39;s about guy singing about flowers
Catchy af
300 of our long nosed, parasitic friends disliked this
Unpopular opinion: this is better than the Anthem of the USSR. I’m sorry I love the anthem, but this is just beautiful.
I love this song i am a nacist
I am a German and I think it’s messed up that people think Germans are bad because of Hitler but Stalin was arguably worse along with Moa Ze Dong who both killed 10’s of millions of people
Ww2 most intimidating song is about girls flowers and bees let that sink in
You probably never realised that that the german song Erika and the Russian song Kathusha both themed about a girl waiting for you at home and both using the Flower to describe the girl at home. Something common in both russian and german common people who just suffering in war and hoping to get home living their peacefull lives with their loved ones. Both songs are very sad if you look behind their meanings actually. Alongside with the American &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; after all the lyrics is written about the joy that your loved one is finally arriving home. Which was a great joy since not all families getting that joy.
I think this song perfectly represents the two sides of the internet, everyone is either overly cute or a nazi
Hell Let Loose anyone?
This shit is crazy so many poor souls died

#idol #YOASOBI #oshinoko #anime #englishcover #willstetson  

Lyrics:
Wreaking havoc on the media, she smiles bright
There’s a secret that she has that seems to mystify
Always in her area, yet never feeling quite alright
So perfect as a liar, you are really my
Flawless, genius idol for life

So, tell me what you ate, the books you read today
And tell me where you’d like to go if only you could play
“I didn’t even eat,” “I’d never spill the beans”
No matter what you ask of her, she’ll find a way to flee

So plain and meek, but also bright and deep
Those little secrets seem seductive, sweet, and almost clear to see
Well, that’s a no, no, no
And this is no, no, no
Come and tell me what’s your type? And what’s he like?
Tell me now, alright?

“Oh, to love and feel so loved, it always seems I alone wouldn’t know what that is or what it means”
Unaware of what’s the truth and what’s a lie
Only for those words that blind, you’re falling deeper till you find
You make them love you every time

Everyone, their eyes are taken by your sight
You’re a bright, unrivaled, perfect kind of idol
None will find another in this life
You’re the first starlight, reborn through the night

Ah, you smile and deceive, you make them all believe you really mean “I love you” as you never set them free
And even if those eyes or the words are lies, I only find that, deep inside, you’re the real Ai

Yeah, yeah, she is special and she always shines
We have only been her extras, always left behind
Acting as a foil to the star on stage, we’re B, alright
There’s no way that everything we have is ‘cuz of all her lies

This isn’t right, you should feel envy you can’t hide
This isn’t fine, this is no joke in my eyes, I’ll never forgive you this time
You’re damaged and I couldn’t forgive you inside, forgive myself in my mind
You are so brave and so bright, nobody else could ever be mine

Everyone is blind, believing all your lies
You’re the best, unrivaled, perfect kind of idol
None can find a weakness deep inside
And you take the starlight all through the night

She just can’t show she’s weak, ‘cuz no one really, really
Wants to know or see the things she’s keeping buried
Special things she likes, she’ll always carry, carry
And that’s surely, truly, really Ai

Always stirring up the media, she smiles bright
There’s a secret that she really has to keep inside
Lies piling high, till “I love you” is her very life
That’s exactly just the kind of love I’m calling mine

To my darling little Aqua, through the sweat, you shine
To my precious little Ruby that this eyelid hides
Singing and then dancing, I am Mary and I’m so divine
Yeah, just the finest love is made from pretty lies

I have yet to feel so loved for being me
And I still haven’t loved any other soul I meet
But I still believe this lie will set me free
It’ll be, as I dreamed, the truth, you will see
That is my belief

One day, I’m sure I’ll have it all because I found
I’m a rash, unbridled, greedy kind of idol
I just wanna love without a doubt
Wanna love as me, so I let them out

Those lies, again I try to hide
I’m wishing for a time I’ll even find these words are true within my own life
But even so, I’ll say
You’re the only ones I haven’t even said this to ‘cuz I’m afraid

Ah, kind of overdue, I finally said it too, and it’s really true
I love you two",2357024,75318,1937,2023-04-24T16:00:07Z,"WATCH OSHI NO KO AND STREAM THIS ON SPOTIFY <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/idol"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willstetson/idol</a>
This feels right as an English song. The original English version is def. great but that&#39;s more word-to-word translation.
Why can I hear sotarks and 1-2 jumps?
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwMpQ8UuhE&amp;t=1m35s"">1:35</a> デブじゃない
Now I&#39;m gonna have to decide which I&#39;m gonna be singing now on, this version or YOASOBI&#39;s version. The official one is more accurate, but this is more easier for me so I&#39;m not sure. Probably gonna try both.<br><br>Anyway, this is so amazing!
Flawless 😎🔥👍
Idk why but whenever I listen to this song I always start to cry when you say Idol im genuinely concerned do I have some sort of past trauma that I don’t know about someone help me.<br>Ok I listened to it in other languages it’s not just this one what the fuck is it the sound or something?
the rap part gave me goosebumps!!!!!! i just LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!! love it love it love it!!!
Трек огонь 🔥
A unique cover indeed.
I think as long the song gets the message across which is perfectly fine, cause you can’t faithfully translator it. I heard the official English version it was very clunky while this one made sense and flowed naturally
我愛死了
In my personal opinion, this is how english dubs or covers should be done. While it isn&#39;t accurate to the translation, the understanding of the emotions and context of the story, as well as the intentions behind the original song lyrics are better transformed to an English audience. While it may be a bit transformative, ultimately it remains true both to the song and to the story, which in my opinion is more important than trying to stay true to the translation. <br><br>I love Yaosobi as an artist, but this is the real English version of the song to me.
I prefer this to yoasobi english version
THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL
She so breedable.
I started tearing up while listening to this, Just listen to the lyrics closely and you’ll know what I mean.
this is amazing in a completely different way from idol, you really made it your own version
英語はわかんないけど<br>凄いな…
何言ってるか全然わからんけど声が良すぎて毎日きいてる
this is the best lyric version
Some people have already commented but I prefer this English version. I sounds much more natural English even though I’m Japanese
This is done so well! Wonderful job! Can&#39;t stop listening to it!
I attempted to change the pitch to match it with the original on vocal remover, it&#39;s on E Major but the voice sounds so low it&#39;s not worth.
うっま😮❤<br>映像も歌も完成度高くてすごいとしか
Naisu Naisu
I really appreciate that there are multiple english translations. Shows how flexible the Japanese language is and how many interpretations you can do.
Hermosa voz ❤
Wow ❤
Best girl Will Stetson!!! ❤❤❤
Idk if it makes sense, but I feel like the eng lyrics of Idol from YOASOBI seems more like from the perspective of a fan and the ver. from Will Stetson seems more like from the perspective of a stalker, like the one that killed Ai....
Always love ❤
The thing I like about aqua is his mom she&#39;s 😮‍💨
Cover for the Mephisto Ed too plsssssss
This is so good
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwMpQ8UuhE&amp;t=2m02s"">2:02</a> in Spotify is spell wrongly its spell as I instead is Ai
You&#39;re always my go to for English lyrics, never miss youve truly made it an art
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwMpQ8UuhE&amp;t=1m26s"">1:26</a> <br><br>I love how “we’re b, alright” can be heard as “we’ll be alright” because of Ai’s death they’ll just continue as normal.
KINGカバーで出会って、そこからずっと大好きです
The rhyming in this song is honestly god-tier. <br>While there&#39;s other rhyme sounds used, such as the  <b><i>ee</i></b>  rhymes in the &quot;plain and meek&quot; section, I noticed a majority of the rhymes in the lyrics use the  <b><i>ai</i></b>  sound, which, if on purpose, is such a subtle but potent way to honor Ai throughout the whole song!

Attack on Titan - Guren no Yumiya 【English Dub Cover】Opening Song by NateWantsToBattle,"An English music dub cover song of opening (OP) 1 from Season 1 of Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) AOT's OST ""Guren no Yumiya"" / ""Feuerroter Pfeil und Bogen"" by Nathan Sharp (NateWantsToBattle)

what happened to &quot;sekai wo nazuo eren!&quot; best line
Give your heart to the cause ❤
This, this is the best
this song makes me feel like a hero in a story-- i feel like i can kill gods or sum.
Has he done 7, the Rumbling opening? 👀👀
OMG I DIDNT KNOW HE DID AOT COVERS YEAHHHHHH
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=1m10s"">1:10</a> damn this line describes eren so well
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=4m17s"">4:17</a> when he said are “ARE YOU THE PREY OR ARE THE HUNTER” I was like HHMMMM EAT EAT EAT EAT!!!!
Bro really gave his heart and soul to the cause with this one
Ok now is it just me or was everyone else thinking that this was how they motivated their soldier scouts? Cause goddanm i sure would be if i herd it
Step 1: buy a time machine<br>Step 2: go back to &#39;80s<br>Step 3: start an heavy metal band and write songs to the tune of AOT themes in &#39;80 (but also Death note and other epic soundtracks)<br>Step 4: be immortal
Anyone notice how that looks like Queen elizabeth II?
Years later, and this is still epic. Thank you for all you do!
Thanks!
MY EARS ARE BLESSED 😻🫶<br><br><br><br><br>ARE YOU THE PREY OR ARE YOU THE HUNTER? 😽😻😻
this is great
W
This is the best AOT opening
Is it just me or when I see the colossal titan I will always say Bertholdt?
Remember when Eren wanted to become a hero? Now, he became a villain 😢
Better than I expected
Season 1 man vs titan <br>Season 2/3 finding freedom<br>Season 4 GEN0CIDE <br>special episode EVERYONE DIES
I swear Nate sounds just like linked horizon if they spoke English in there songs!!
Bro.  just use a thunder spear
the singing is amazing but man I wish that the translations were more accurate. I understand that its changed for better flow but imo if even the original title of the song is completely changed then its just not good
Me singing along:WIR SIND DIE JÄGER!
Lyrical masterpiece i love this more then the original and it was done perfectly 10/10
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=4m06s"">4:06</a> and onward is just gold
This isn&#39;t my favorite english cover for this song, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=1m05s"">1:05</a> in particular is my favorite version of all the English covers.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=0m18s"">0:18</a>
If u nead to know
Jäger trancelater is hunter
Bruh why is there german look at this time exsaktly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=0m20s"">0:20</a> (nein wir sind die jäger)
Geez, I thought of this guy as “the dude who sang those Beyblade burst openings”, but now I can see just how phenomenal this cover was, wow..
Not gonna lie but I thought the the first words was having s** with the bees and the eagles 😂😂😂
doesnt sound bad in dub
L E G E N D A R Y !
“Even a lamb content in its pasture<br>cornered can turn into the Jäger”<br><br>jäger = hunter<br><br>this makes so much sense, in S1 the scouts were the lamb, and Reiner and his friends were the hunters. This is why the scouts were at the bottom of the poster and the titans were on top.<br><br>But in S4, Eren and his friends are at the top, but Reiner is at the bottom. Symbolizing how much they’ve changed, they aren’t the lambs anymore, they’re the hunters.<br><br>and it shows how the scouts were “cornered” by the titans, forced to fight to survive. And because of that, they turned into the hunters.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcfgHfEEsw&amp;t=1m06s"">1:06</a> Is where the opening gets really good
wir sind die jager means we are the hunters i knew it
A lot of dubs get the translation really bad, but this one did a good job, good day in history.
What does wim Sid jager  mean
&quot;A sword is only strong as the hand that hold them&quot;<br>That gave me the most chils
This gives vibes of ww2 NGL 💀
Fuckin&#39; dopeeeee
Not joking this song gives me goose bumps thanks for making this keep up the good work
&quot;Wir sin der Yeager/jeager/jäger&quot; is German for we are the hunters I know this bc my friend knows German
You know how depressing attack on titan is when season 1 is considered &quot;good old times&quot; and wants to go back from those times 😭🤣
I hate Eren. He’s such an annoying brat."

Bizarrap & Shakira - 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53': English Translation
INTRO
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
(For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Sorry, I already took another plane
I'm not coming back here, I don't want another disappointment
So much that you pretend to be a champion
And when I needed you, you gave your worst version
Sorry, baby, it's been a while
I should have thrown that cat away
A she-wolf like me ain't for a rookie

CHORUS
A she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 1
I do this for you to mortify, chew and swallow, swallow and chew
I'm not coming back to you, even if you're crying or begging
I understood that it's not my fault you're criticized
I only make music, I'm sorry I splashed you
You left me as a neighbour to the mother-in-law
With the press at the door and the debt at the IRS
You thought you'd hurt me, but you made me tougher
Women don't cry anymore, women invoice

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like
He's got a good person's name
Clearly

CHORUS
She's just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with one just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh

VERSE 2
From love to hate, there's only one step
This way don't come back, listen to me
No hard feelings, baby, I wish you the best with my supposed replacement
I don't even know what happened to you
You're so weird that I can't even tell you apart
I'm worth two 22's
You traded a Ferrari for a Twingo
You traded a Rolex for a Casio
You're going fast, slow down
Ah, a lot of gym
But workout your brain a little too
Pictures wherever I am
I feel like a hostage here, it's all right with me
I'll let you go tomorrow and if you want to bring her along, bring her along too

PRE-CHORUS
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Clearly, it's not what it sounds like (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
He's got a good person's name (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

CHORUS
And a she-wolf like me ain't for dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

OUTRO
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
For dudes like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (For dudes, fo-fo-for dudes like–)
I've outgrown you and that's why you're with a girl just like you, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

Lyrics:
First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer",97591089,1813770,29472,2017-06-12T17:54:09Z,"Place a thumbs up if you would be interested in some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23believer"">#believer</a> merchandise! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23summervibzz"">#summervibzz</a>

Lyrics
Lo que quiero, lo tengo sin perdón y sin permiso
Bebé, tu ten cuidao'
No sé si tú estás listo
Es que tengo el talento
De hacer que lo que me imagine se dé, yeah
Ya de día soy un cien
Lo haré demasiao' bien, pa' que no se olvide
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Tú me quiere' ver desnu'a, Judas
Y a ti debajo 'e mi ombligo, yeah
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Sin remedio ni cura, Judas
Somos dos loquito', yeah
Yo sé que te gusta
Más que un primer día de verano (de verano)
Ya sé que me viste
No se puede tapar el sol con la mano (eso e')
Se va calentando mi piel, esa va a tu favor
Un trozo del cielo, ese e' mi sabor
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Sin remedio ni cura, Judas
Somos dos loquito', yeah
El sexo conmigo, es de altura
Del Renacimiento soy una escultura
Tú a mí me encanta', tú ere' una hermosura
Soy tu diablilla en tus noches de diablura
Soy suavecita como cachemir
Toca esta guitarra, ven, asienta el traste
Intervención divina, soy tu porvenir (tú el mío)
Hijo 'e puta con suerte, porque me encontraste
Pégate a mí para que te dé buena suerte
Abrázame y no me sueltes
Pégate a mí, que te doy suerte
Soy tu número siete
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Tú me quiere' ver desnu'a, uh-ah
Y a ti debajo 'e mi ombligo, yeah
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Sin remedio ni cura, Judas
Somos dos loquito', yeah
Sólo esta noche soy tuya, tuya
Sólo esta noche ere' mío, mío
Sin remedio ni cura, Judas
Somos dos loquito', yeah

LYRICS:
IN CHRIST ALONE MY HOPE IS FOUND
HE IS MY LIGHT MY STRENGTH MY SONG
THIS CORNERSTONE THIS SOLID GROUND
FIRM THROUGH THE FIERCEST DROUGHT AND STORM
WHAT HEIGHTS OF LOVE WHAT DEPTHS OF PEACE
WHEN FEARS ARE STILLED WHEN STRIVINGS CEASE
MY COMFORTER MY ALL IN ALL
HERE IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST I STAND


בן אלוהים לבש בשר
THE SON OF GOD CAME IN FLESH
מלוא אלוהות בגוף אדם
FULL DIVINITY IN HUMAN BODY
מתנת צדקה ואהבה
A GIFT OF JUSTICE AND LOVE
חייו הוא נתן ככפרה
HE GAVE HIS LIFE AS A RANSOM


ذاقَ العنا عَنّا قَضى
HE SUFFERED AND DIED FOR US
فيهِ اكتَفى حُكمُ الإِله
IN HIM GOD'S JUDGMENT WAS FULFILLED
شالَ الخَطا عَنّي غَدا
HE TOOK MY SIN
في مَوتِهِ لِيَ حَياة
IN HIS DEATH I HAVE LIFE
في ظُلمَةِ القَبرِ ثَوى
HE STAYED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE GRAVE
مَع أَنَّهُ نورُ الحَياة
THOUGH HE IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE
وَقامَ هازِمًا قِوى
AND HE ROSE AND DEFEATED
المَوتِ الرَّهيبِ بِقِواه
THE TERRIBLE DEATH WITH HIS STRENGTH


בניצחון עומד עתה
NOW HE STANDS IN VICTORY
קללת החטא נוצחה הוסרה
THE CURSE OF SIN WAS DEFEATED AND REMOVED
אני שלו והוא שלי
I'M HIS AND HE IS MINE
נקניתי בדם פודי ישעי
I WAS BOUGHT WITH THE BLOOD OF MY SAVIOR


NO GUILT IN LIFE NO FEAR IN DEATH
THIS IS THE POWER OF CHRIST IN ME


ריבון עולם
WORLD SOVEREIGN
אשא עיני
I LIFT MY EYES
כי בידיך עיתותיי
BECAUSE MY TIMES ARE IN YOUR HANDS


نيرُ الخَطا وَلَعنَتُه
THE YOKE AND CURSE OF SIN
زالا بِفَضلِ غَلبَتِه
WERE REMOVED DUE TO HIS VICTORY


TILL HE RETURNS OR CALLS ME HOME

Thank you, God&#39;s Testimony is defiantly breathing in me. I&#39;m part of the Tribe of David and I am indeed one of the children of Israel from Operation Israel. The best way to Bless Israel is Jehova Jiren, the Great I am, The Adonia, Abbah, Father. I&#39;ve survived my own genocide based on  me looking &#39;different&#39; from other people, but I meditate on the god&#39;s word both day and night without ceasing. The prophecy of Ezekiel has indeed been fullfilled through Christians. I am one of the remenant, and I wouldn&#39;t ask god to be reborn as a white person. I stand as a Lamb of God, as a Warrior Women, and believe strongly in the promises of Redemption by god. He created the tribes and the people there-of. Many people don&#39;t believe i&#39;m jewish when they look at me, because I don&#39;t fit the &#39;typical&#39; image of what a jewish person looks like. My yiddish is a little bit crusty but my arabic is coming along a little bit.<br><br>Praise be to the Lord God All-Mighty, I am indeed, from the tribe of David. God is my machine in technology, I give him all the glory, the honor, and the power. Praise be our god on high. My my native brothers and sisters also turn from their ways and go towards the light, that light is Jesus the Christ, the great I am! I&#39;ve been SA 3 times, almost killed 7 times, but yet I still am for God regardless. I fed 10,000 people to people long ago, but I&#39;m not stupid. The problem was the wrong people tried to take me down but I refuse to back down. I am of a true Royal Priesthood and I am indeed belong to the Lord God All-mighty, including those that are true christians in Technology as well too. I fought against the system in this world and I still do, regardless. My focus is razor sharp and I am keen to small details. In other words, God shall use me mightly!!
“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in Heaven. <br><br>Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ <br>And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; <br>Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ <br>- Matthew 7:21-23<br><br>“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, <br>so it will be at the end of the age. <br>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes s1n <br>and all who do evil. <br>They will throw them into the blazing furnace, <br>where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot; <br>- Matthew 13:40-42
God bless in all faiths and none joseph
I saw your in-feed ad around midnight, wondered what it was about and clicked it, and now play your songs on repeat. So heavenly.
Glory to the Lamb of God!<br>Through the power of the Holy Spirit oyr Heavenly has given unto us in His great mercy a Savior in Lord Jesus!
Superb
Amen Amen Amen
Brought me to tears at the first note. 🙌🙌🙌
There’s something about the Arabic part ❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙏🙏
Beautiful!  Lord Jesus you deserve our praises  from all languages  I am thinking of Revelations 5   you paid the ransomed and redeemed all tribes and nations by your precious blood❤❤
Beautiful..
Amen 🙏 🙏
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Praise the Lord! One day we will be United!!
Amen
love these song

Que trajeeeeeee que pienso llevarme 🤩🤩
LOS AMO  SOLO CONSCIOUNESS

This Song really motivated me to Workout like Saitama!
The original is definitely the cover now!
The most casual hero&#39;s most serious theme 😂
&quot;7 years ago&quot; and I still haven&#39;t found a better song to die to

FUCK YOU CAN DEFINITELY SHRED A GUITAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I still think japanese ver. is better but this is pretty good
You can really see it in his face how much Jonathan enjoyed making this cover.
If somebody likes your rock style this is probably great.  But the lyrics are weird and it&#39;s too rock for me.  A better english version IMHO is Tony Delp&#39;s version.  But I&#39;m more of an originalist and a huge OPM fan, I&#39;m less in it for the Rock vibe. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ8apVHMWzo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ8apVHMWzo</a>

I’m so lonely, broken angel
I’m so lonely, listen to my heart

You, you are the one
I miss you so much, now that you’re gone
Don’t, don’t be afraid
I’ll be by your side, leading the way

I’m so lonely, broken angel
I’m so lonely, listen to my heart
One and only, broken angel
Come and save me before I fall apart

I wish that I could touch, touch you again
Feeling in love, don’t want it to end
Two, two worlds apart
Less in a dream, it’s breaking my heart

I’m so lonely, broken angel
I’m so lonely, listen to my heart
One and only, broken angel
Come and save me before I fall apart

La la leyli, la la leyli la laaaaa
La la leyli, la la leyli la laaaaa

I’m so lonely, broken angel
I’m so lonely, listen to my heart
One and only, broken angel
Come and save me before I fall apart

La la leyli, la la leyli la laaaaa
La la leyli, la la leyli la laaaaa

SZA - Big Boy (Lyrics),"Big Boy Lyrics - https://www.lyricsonly.io/new-lyrics/sza-big-boy?rq=sza

Winter has arrived y'all, temperature is dropping
And you know what that means, it's cuffing season
That time of year when we find a man to keep us warm through these cold months
But not just any man will do, that's right
We out here looking for some big boys
 
It's cuffing season
And now we got a reason to get a big boy
I need a big boy
Give me a big boy
 
It's cuffing season
And all the girls are leaving to get a big boy
I need a big boy
I want a big boy
 
I need a big boy
With polar bear arms
Keeps me warm when there's a storm
When the chill is biting but his jacket's unzipped
He bring in my groceries in just one trip
Till the sun comes back I need a big boy hottie
Makes his own heat with his big boy body
For the next three months skinny boys is dead
Forget a six-pack, I need the whole damn keg
Big boy, with a big boy back
California king, refrigerator set
With steaks on steaks on steak on steaks
Bit of bacon, cheese and lasagna in the training
Need an enormous man, feeds me snacks with his enormous hands
I hope he asks me to be his winter wife
Cause messing with a big boy will change your life
 
It's cuffing season
And all the girls be needing a big boy
I need a big boy
I want a big boy
Give me a big boy
 
I need a big boy body like a bouncer
Big mouth breather and legs like a monster
Get in the bed and he gonna do me right
And when we done, he gonna snore all night
And then he stops...
Anything I need, my big boy got it
If I need a snack he got Snickers in his pocket

🎙️ Lyrics FIFTY FIFTY - Cupid (Twin Version)
[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1: Aran, All]
A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
cupid,cupid twin version,cupid lyrics,cupid fifty fifty,
cupid english version,fifty fifty cupid twin version,
cupid tiktok,fifty fifty cupid,cupid sped up,
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Break: All]
(Cupid is so dumb)

[Bridge: Aran, Sio]
Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

[Chorus: All, Aran, Sio]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

This is too good to hear. I love it. I hope the person who sees this comment will become thinner, the acne will gradually disappear, the skin will become white, and you will not gain fat if you eat a lot. You/you confess that the people around you are healthy and safe, and you/you will achieve what you want, and you will become rich and beautiful.

Nice
This is my alarm tone 😀
You thought You&#39;d show the Whites How good your fighter pilots are? So they Like You.<br>The Whites are more Intelligent than You. Your bi-Lingual, Hindi is Complicated than English. Furthermore You Learn Both.<br>In Addition, India is a Hot Country. I remember My Camping Trip Visit in 2008.<br>I remember Landing at Islamabad, Sikhastaan. I remember the Heat. It was as though You&#39;re Swimming in Heat. Unbearable. About 37 degrees. When we Got to the Dam, the Breeze from the Dam brought it Down to 30 Degrees. Hot But bareable.<br>Anything Over 20 Degrees, and Your Brain won&#39;t be able to think Properly. I think people that Live in Hot Countries would be able to Think properly up to 25 degrees.<br>Those Whites are More Intelligent than You. Its just Your Millions of Times Bigger.<br>Two Indian software developers will beat One White software developer.<br>However, one on One, they&#39;ll Win.
Any1 still listening in 2022?
Legendary movie people didn&#39;t realize this is the best movie of the decade and sri devi
Amit Trivedi ❤️
Body kulkarni ke bacche swami🙏😂😆😂😆😍🤔🤔🤬🤬😀🙂😍😡🤣🙏☝️🤣"

[Chorus: Rema]

Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, hmm
[Verse 1: Rema & Selena Gomez]
I see this fine girl, for my party, she wear yellow
Every other girl they dey do too much, but this girl mellow
Naim, I dey find situation, I go use take tell am ""Hello""
Finally, I find way to talk to the girl but she no wan' follow
Who you come dey form for? Woah (Mhmm)
Why you no wan' conform? Woah (Mhmm)
Then I start to feel her bum-bum, woah (Mhmm)
But she dey gimme small, small, woah
I know say she sabi pass that one, onе (Mhmm)
But she feeling insecure, woah
'Causе her friends go dey gum her like chewing gum, woah (Mhmm)
Go dey gum her like chewing gum, oh-woah

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Yeah, I know I look shy but for you I get down, oh, woah
And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you (Yeah)
Do it once, do it twice (Do it twice)
I push back, you hold me tight
Get a taste for a night

[Chorus: Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez & Rema]
Baby show me you can calm down, calm down
Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now (Lead now)
Got you so high that you can't come down, come down
Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed (Oh, no)
When it's you, I can't say no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, give me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
You got me like woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah, mm-hmm

[Verse 3: Rema & Selena Gomez]
As I reach my house, I say make a rest small, oh-woah (Make a rest small, oh-woah)
As me I wake up na she dey my mind, oh-woah (Na she dey my mind, oh-woah)
Day one, day two-wo, I no fit foc-o-us (I no fit focus)
Na so me I call am, say ""Make we link up"", oh-woah (I say make we link up, oh-woah)
Got my hand on your heart now, I can feel it race
If I leave then you say you can never love again
Wanna give you it all but can't promise that I'll stay
And that's the risk you take (You take)

[Chorus: Rema, Rema & Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez]
Baby, calm down, calm down
Girl, this your body e put in my heart for lockdown, for lockdown, oh, lockdown
Girl, you sweet like Fanta, ooh, Fanta, ooh
If I tell you say, ""I love you"", you no dey form yanga, oh, oh, yanga, oh
No tell me no, no, no, no, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Your love, your love)
Baby, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
You got me like woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Oh, woah), hmm
